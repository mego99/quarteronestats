  <h1>Quarter One Project</h1>
  <p>
    As a soon-to-be college freshman (hopefully!),
    I've been spending a fair share of my time scouring university websites, scanning colorful pamphlets, and making big decisions.
    When I stumbled upon the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/">US College Scorecard</a>, I knew I had found my goldmine.
    This data, collected and compiled by the US Department of Education, is an extremely comprehensive and well-documented dataset freely available to
    the public. It contains information on colleges, their student body, cost of attendance, financial aid, and earnings after graduation.
